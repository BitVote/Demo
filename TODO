I am trying to insert 4 java timers into my Proof-of-concept page at 
http://arkbg1.github.io/BitVote/


after a user clicks the "start here" button, 
one timer says "Current Time" in milliseconds 
then a data input table then a code log. 
I need it to have 4 timers instead of 1.


1. Registration Time: MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm:ss   
(static counter, capturing the time stamp of user click. similar to w3schools(.)com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_date_gettime except in MM/DD/YY hh:mm:ss format.

2. Current Time: MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm:ss   
(counting live. similar to  w3schools(.)com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_timing_clock

3. Spent Vote-Time: 00:00:00  
(static counter. ignore this for now.)

4. Available Vote-Time: hh:mm:ss  
(live counter, basic stop watch starting after click)


Every time I try to copy paste w3school code into my github code, the page breaks. 
I tried 44 commits yesterday. nothings working and I dont know what im doing to break the current code 
or how to add these 4 basic timers without breaking the page.

here is the index.html and js.js - https://github.com/arkbg1/BitVote
