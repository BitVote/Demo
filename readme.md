<p>BitVote is the self-developing core of a digital ecosystem that empowers the people to interpret and express themselves in measurable ways by codifying linkable time units of real life individual human beings as opposed to upvoting fake internet points the way old websites did. BitVote will protect Ethereum - as well as the entire Internet - from Social and Political Attacks by providing the people with a revolutionary yet deceptively simple protection to guard their future while avoiding old tools proven unable to fix old problems.
