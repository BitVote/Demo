<h1>Bitvote</h1>

<p>BitVote is a self-developing digital ecosystem that empowers the people to interpret and express themselves in measurable ways by codifying time units of real life individual human beings as opposed upvoting fake internet points the way old websites did. BitVote will protect Ethereum - as well as the entire Internet - from Social and Political Attacks not by wasting time on those old tools proven unable to fix old problems - but by providing people with revolutionary yet deceptively simple protections to guard the future of the internet.
